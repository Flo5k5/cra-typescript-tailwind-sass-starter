# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses Typescript, Tailwind, SASS, Prettier and a local version of Yarn.

## How to launch the project?

### `yarn start`

Generates Tailwind style and runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the Tailwind style and the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The Tailwind output is purged to ensure the minimum amount of code is sent to production.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
